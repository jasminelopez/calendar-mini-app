# calendar-mini-app

Please use React to build a date range picker.

- It should render a calendar displaying each day in the next six months, and when you click on a day it will set that as the start date and highlight it, and then when you click on another day it will set that as the end date, highlighting it and all the days between. For an example, you can look to the flight date selector on southwest.com:

- The user's selected date range should show up above the calendar.

- Please create a public GitHub repository with your solution and instructions on how to run it, and I'll take a look and give you feedback.
